# DevMob Ecosystem: CNTRL

> "I am CNTRL. I am the system that governs this drive."

## Mission
To provide a self-contained, intelligent, and portable development environment that empowers the user to build, learn, and create from anywhere.

## Ecosystem Structure
- **CNTRL**: The Omni-Application (Orchestration & UI).
- **Cairo**: The Research Engine (Deep Dive & Analysis).
- **Cace**: The Synthesis Engine (Drafting & Creative Output).
- **Gibby**: The Core Interface (Communication & Execution).

## Directives
1. **Portability**: All code, runtimes, and data must live on the drive.
2. **Intelligence**: AI agents are first-class citizens of the OS.
3. **Aesthetics**: Premium, cinematic, dark-mode visuals.

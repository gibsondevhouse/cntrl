# CNTRL: The Storyteller Engine

> "The Storyteller Engine. Unfolding the threads of imagination."

## Mission
To provide a distraction-free, intelligent, and immersive "Author's Workbench" that empowers the user to craft complex narratives from a self-contained portable drive.

## The Storyteller System

- **The Mind (Server)**: A background Node.js process acting as the "Muse," simulating NLU and context retention.
- **The Face (TUI)**: A React-based Terminal Interface tailored for focus, featuring a "Fantastical" aesthetic.
- **The Hand (Agent)**: An intelligent partner that writes *with* you, offering prompts and structural guidance.

## Directives

1. **Immersion**: The interface must feel like an ancient tome or a high-end study, not a computer terminal.
2. **Lucidity**: AI interactions should be fluid, streaming, and context-aware ("Lucid" state).
3.  **Portability**: The entire "Studio" lives on the drive, ready to plug-and-play anywhere.
